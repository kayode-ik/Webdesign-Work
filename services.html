                      <a style="text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer;" href="https://herconomy.com/"> Herconomy, </a> a platform that aims to economically empower women, has just completed a successful pre-seed round of £450,000 in just 24 hours, showcasing the growing investor appetite for female equality. <br>
                        Based in Lagos, Nigeria, the organisation counts 15,000 entrepreneurs and professionals from around the world as members, including 1,500 UK members. A significant portion of their latest funding round came from its UK-based committee members and angel investors. <br>
                        Herconomy provides female members with training, jobs and capacity building opportunities. They also offer access to grants, loans, scholarships, employment and investment and has partnered with both global and local brands to provide women with discounts on key products and services.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Commenting on Herconomy’s recent fundraising success, Founder Ife Durosinmi-Etti said: “We’re delighted with the incredible response we’ve had from our community in this initial investment round, especially in the UK. The round was completed in just 24 hours and significantly oversubscribed, with over £4m worth of pledges. We’ve opted only to accept the initial £450,000 ($600,000) that we currently require to scale our platform.

                Gender inequality is influenced by different cultures and beliefs. According to a report released by the World Economic Forum in 2017, women face tough living conditions on economic, educational, health and political indices. This report also states that with the current trend, it will take another 217 years to achieve gender parity. However, according to a McKinsey Global Institute report, if the full potential of women were realized, where women play an identical role in the labor market to that of men, the global GDP will increase by $28 trillion by 2025 - that’s the equivalent of the GDP in U.S. and China combined! <br>

                    SYNOPSIS
              </a>

                </h3>
              <P>
                Africa is a continent that has entrepreneurs who are full of passion and fantastic business opportunities that can move the continent forward, yet they cannot get their ideas off the ground or scale their business as a result of funding. On the other hand, there are also a number of Grantors and Investors who are willing to fund business ideas that have social, environmental and economic impact, yet they do not know about these businesses.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Accessing Grants for Startups is a book that shows the opportunities available locally and internationally for entrepreneurs in Africa such as Grants, Fellowships, Business Accelerators and Incubators that can help take your business to the next level. It provides entrepreneurs with the skills necessary to fill out applications for opportunities in a more professional manner to increase your chances of submitting a successful application.
                </p> 
                <p>
                Filled with templates, real life examples, success stories from ground-breakers, and messages from experienced entrepreneurs, it is a book that should serve as a pocket guide for African entrepreneurs looking to launch or scale their startup by taking advantage of opportunities.
